# 2N Doorbell Monitor

I have a 2N IP Solo at home and wanted to receive a telegram message with the snapshot from the doorbell's camera when someone was at the door.
I put this together in a few, so it may not be as "production ready" as it may seems, feel free to submit any PR :)

## Config

see config.ini-example, this should be pretty self explanatory.

## Example running
